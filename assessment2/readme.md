# Resilient Distributed Task Processing System

This project is a scalable backend system for distributed task processing, designed to handle millions of tasks daily across multiple workers. The system ensures tasks are processed efficiently and robustly, even when interacting with unreliable external APIs.

## System Architecture

![Architecture Flow Diagram](./A_simple_architecture_flow_diagram_on_a_white_back.png)

The architecture flow is designed to balance performance and resilience, addressing the key requirements for task prioritization, reliability, and fault tolerance.

### Key Components

1. **Client**: Initiates tasks, submitting them to the system.
2. **Task Queue (Redis/Bull)**: Stores tasks in a distributed queue using Bull with Redis as the backend, supporting deduplication and exactly-once processing. Tasks are prioritized based on urgency.
3. **Short Task Queue**: Processes time-sensitive tasks with a timeout restriction.
4. **Long Task Queue**: Processes longer-running tasks without a timeout restriction, ensuring that short tasks are unaffected.
5. **Workers (Short Task Worker, Long Task Worker)**: Dedicated workers pull tasks from their respective queues, handling external API requests and implementing retries with exponential backoff in case of failures.
6. **External API**: Represents an external dependency for each task. The system uses retry logic to manage failures when interacting with this API.
7. **Redis for Deduplication**: Tracks the status of tasks to prevent duplicate processing and ensure exactly-once processing.

## Features

- **Horizontal Scalability**: Supports multiple workers and can be scaled as task volume grows.
- **Retries with Exponential Backoff**: Ensures robust handling of intermittent API failures.
- **Long-Running Task Support**: Separate queue for long tasks avoids timeouts for tasks requiring extended processing.
- **Task Prioritization**: Enables prioritizing tasks based on urgency.
- **Exactly-once Processing**: Ensures tasks are processed only once, even in case of worker failures.

## Code Structure

### `taskProcessingSystem.js`

- **`retryWithBackoff`**: Implements retry logic with exponential backoff to handle transient errors in external API calls.
- **`callExternalApi`**: Sends the task data to an external API and handles the response.
- **`processTask`**: Manages task processing, checking the task's current status to avoid duplicates, and updating Redis with the final task status.
- **`addTaskToQueue`**: Adds tasks to either the short or long queue based on priority and task type (short or long).

### Example Code Snippet for Task Processing

```javascript
async function processTask(job, taskType) {
  const taskData = job.data;
  const taskId = taskData.id;
  const statusKey = `task_status_${taskId}`;

  // Check if task is already processed
  const status = await redisClient.get(statusKey);
  if (status === 'completed') return;

  // Process task with exponential backoff
  try {
    const result = await retryWithBackoff(() => callExternalApi(taskData), 3);
    await redisClient.set(statusKey, 'completed');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Failed to process task ${taskId}:`, error);
  }
}
```

## Setup and Running the Code

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or above)
- Redis Server
- Bull queue library for Node.js
- Mocked Redis library (`redis-mock`) for testing purposes

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amulyakashyap09/smartlead.git
   cd smartlead/assessment2
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Ensure Redis is running on your local machine or specify the Redis server connection in your environment variables.

4. Don;t forget to replace with actual API call in function `callExternalApi`

### Running the Application

1. Start the Redis server.
2. Execute the main application code:
   ```bash
   node assessment2.js
   ```

## Running Tests

The project uses Jest for testing. Unit tests cover the retry logic, API call handling, Redis interactions, and queue management to ensure robust functionality. `redis-mock` is used to simulate Redis behavior for testing.

1. Run tests with coverage:
   ```bash
   npx jest --coverage
   ```

2. Test suite details:
   - **Retry Logic Tests**: Verifies exponential backoff and max retry attempts.
   - **API Call Tests**: Checks for successful API calls and error handling.
   - **Queue and Deduplication Tests**: Ensures correct queue management and deduplication in Redis.
